# Task 2 parts A and B

The point of parts A and B is to demonstrate competency in communicating your technical solution to different less technical audiences. Follow the [Task 2 documentation template](https://westerngovernorsuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/jim_ashe_wgu_edu/ERGxhsNfkbhEutlkXVFITMQBPOmWlkVx1p5H0UisvnBesg?rtime=3q_Efs-u2kg)

- Part A - convince general leadership
- Part B - convince IT leadership (but not CS experts) or middle management.

Part D, explains the CS-related aspects of your project and (with the exception of the [User Guide](task2d:userguide)) should target the computer science subject matter experts -the evaluators. The evaluators are *not* business majors, and neither does the rubric have any qualtive business criteria for parts A and B. As such, parts A and B aspects like budgets, methodoloty, and planning parts are not assessed rigorously from a business perspective.

## Part A
Throughout part A: 

- Target the non-technical senior leadership of the organization. 

- Write everything in the future tense. 

All page-length recommendations are *only suggestions*. There is no minimal page requirement, and the rubric only specifies that provided details be complete and logical. The proper content depth depends on your project. 

(task2:parta:letter)=
### Letter of Transmittal

- Summarize the problem. 

- Recommend a solution centered around your application. 

- Describe how the proposed solution benefits the organization. 

- Estimate of the total dollar cost (this should match the value given in [Funding Requirements](task2:parta:funding) of part A). 

- Describe the expertise and experience which qualify you to develop the solution.  

- Include all artifacts typical of a professional (business) letter, e.g., subject line, date, greeting, signature, etc. (see [task 2 examples](resources:examples))
