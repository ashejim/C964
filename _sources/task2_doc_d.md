# Task 2 part D 
Part D of the documentation explains the technical details of your project and should target the computer science subject matter expert, i.e., the evaluators. Hence, of the documentation, part D is most valued and scrutinized by the evaluators. Of part D, the [Data Product Code](task2d:dataproduct), [Accuracy Analysis](task2d:accuracy), and [User Guide](task2d:userguide) are most important. As such, we recommend completeing on these sections first.

(task2d:userguide)=
## User Guide

The evaluator might go here first. Following your instructions, they will run your app, simultaneously verifying it runs as intended and gaining context of its purpose through demonstration. 

Include an enumerated (steps 1, 2, 3, etc.) guide to execute and use your application. The evaluator will play the "client" role and follow your instructions as provided. So make them "dummy" proof. You should include instructions for downloading and installing any necessary software or libraries (they'll have most of these installed anyways). Your application will be considered “user-friendly” if the evaluator successfully executes and uses your application on a Windows 10 machine following your instructions.

- **Provide examples.** Examples not only make the instructions easier to follow (hence easier to pass), but also demonstrate how the app solves the organizational need. When applicable provide sample input or input which can be copied and pasted. 

- **Test.** Create a new environment or borrow a friend's computer, follow your instructions verbatim, and verify that everything works as expected. It's easy to overlook small details.

:::{margin} No Windows machine?
*Nowhere is Windows specifically required* in the C964 rubric. However, WGU evaluators are only issued Windows 10 machines, and they may have difficulty running a Linux or Mac app without special instructions. Therefore, we recommend that the [user guide](task2_doc:userguide) provide explicit instructions for a Windows 10 user to run your code, such as using a [virtual machine](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-run-ubuntu-desktop-on-a-virtual-machine-using-virtualbox#1-overview), remote machine, or using a [Linux subsytem](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-10#1-overview). You should also provide a note when submitting to Assessments and alerting your course instructor. See the [Task 2 part C FAQ](task2c:faq:linux) for more details.

(task2d:dataproduct)=
## Data Product Code

This section should describe the development of your ML application justifying and explaining decisions made in the process. Explain the *what*, *how*, and *why* of the machine learning model and its application.

(task2d:accuracy)=
## Accuracy Analysis
