**WGU Capstone Excellence Archive**

The [Capstone Excellence Archive](https://westerngovernorsuniversity.sharepoint.com/sites/capstonearchives/excellence/Pages/UndergraduateInformation.aspx) includes a wide range of completed projects. Reviewing them may help get ideas, provide inspiration, and understand the requirements. However, keep in mind that they all are *above and beyond* the requirements. Therefore, don't use these as examples of what's needed to meet the requirements. For a more down-to-earth example of what's required, see the [examples](resources:examples) above.

### Excellence Archive

The Capstone Excellence Archive includes a wide range of completed projects. When reviewing archived capstones, keep in mind that they all are, by definition, above and beyond the requirements. Therefore, do not use these as examples of what’s needed to meet the requirements. For a more down-to-earth example of what’s required, see the [examples](resources:examples) above.

## Task 2 Parts A, B, & C (the documenation) Resources

(resources:task2doc:doctemplate)= 
### Task 2 Parts A, B, and D Template & Part C Guide
Write your proposal following **C964 Task 2 documentation template**:

> [![Task 2: documentation template](https://github.com/ashejim/C964/blob/main/url_images/template_task2.png?raw=true#image-thumb)](https://westerngovernorsuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/jim_ashe_wgu_edu/ERGxhsNfkbhEutlkXVFITMQBPOmWlkVx1p5H0UisvnBesg?rtime=3q_Efs-u2kg)

Follow the guidelines found in this template and webpage -*do **not** follow the official rubric and task directions found on the C964 COS page*. Because of the ambiguity of the rubric (how does direction A-D align with Outcomes 1-6?), this template has become the defacto rubric. reserve the template section titles and order and submit all four parts as a single document. With a long, complicated document, aligning content to assessed competencies presents a challenge. Don't make things difficult for the evaluator by spreading the content over several documents in an unfamiliar format.

Contrasting the recommended approach to C950 and C951, *we do not advise completing your application (part C) OR writing your document (parts A) following the specific items listed in the official rubric _or task _directions_._* 

*We do not advise following the official rubric for C964.* Follow the guidelines found on this webpage and the [Task 2 template](https://westerngovernorsuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/jim_ashe_wgu_edu/ESLuMNRuDjpCrKvqWaC6cywB4I97WEPdk5MRZRq4LfmFhQ). Because of the ambiguity of the official rubric (how do directions A-D align with Outcomes 1-6?), following this template is helpful (almost necessary) in aligning your documentation with the rubric outcomes. So while following the template format is not technically required, it is highly recommended.

Preserve the template's section titles, and order, and submit all four parts as a single document (preferably a pdf). With a long, complicated document, aligning content to competencies presents a challenge. Don't make things difficult for the evaluator by spreading the content over several documents in an unfamiliar format.

-[Writing Center Knowledge Base](https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/Writing-Center-Knowledge-Base/tkb-p/C770_kb)

(resources:gen:grammarly)=
### Grammarly.com

Check your grammar using [Grammarly.com](https://www.grammarly.com/) ![grammarly](https://github.com/ashejim/C769/blob/main/url_images/icon-grammarly.png?raw=true#icon) (it's what the evaluators use). Style is not assessed (blue and green), but even a few grammar mistakes will prevent competency in *Professional Communication*. The free side has been sufficient, but if using the online app, you sometimes need to wait before mistakes are caught.

:::{warning}
Students have reported missed mistakes when using the Google doc Grammarly extension. Therefore, we advise copying content directly into the app or purchasing the premium version and checking grammar in MS Word.
