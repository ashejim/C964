**WGU Capstone Excellence Archive**

The [Capstone Excellence Archive](https://westerngovernorsuniversity.sharepoint.com/sites/capstonearchives/excellence/Pages/UndergraduateInformation.aspx) includes a wide range of completed projects. Reviewing them may help get ideas, provide inspiration, and understand the requirements. However, keep in mind that they all are *above and beyond* the requirements. Therefore, don't use these as examples of what's needed to meet the requirements. For a more down-to-earth example of what's required, see the [examples](resources:examples) above.

### Excellence Archive

The Capstone Excellence Archive includes a wide range of completed projects. When reviewing archived capstones, keep in mind that they all are, by definition, above and beyond the requirements. Therefore, do not use these as examples of what’s needed to meet the requirements. For a more down-to-earth example of what’s required, see the [examples](resources:examples) above.

## Task 2 Parts A, B, & C (the documetation) Resources

Part C is your submitted application. See all our available resources here: [task 2 part C](task2_part_c)

(resources:task2doc:doctemplate)=

### Task 2 Parts A, B, and D Template & Part C Guide

Write your proposal following **C964 Task 2 documentation template**:

> [![Image of the first page of the Task 2 documentation template](https://github.com/ashejim/C964/blob/main/url_images/template_task2.png?raw=true#image-thumb)](https://westerngovernorsuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/jim_ashe_wgu_edu/ERGxhsNfkbhEutlkXVFITMQBPOmWlkVx1p5H0UisvnBesg?rtime=3q_Efs-u2kg)

<!-- Contrasting the recommended approach to most WGU projects you've passed, e.g., C950 and C951, *we do not advise completing your application (part C) OR writing your document (parts A) following the specific items listed in the official rubric _or task directions.*  Written holistically, many find it difficult to align the task directions (A-D) to the rubric outcomes (1-6). Please refer to the guidelines on this webpage and the [Task 2 template](https://westerngovernorsuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/jim_ashe_wgu_edu/ERGxhsNfkbhEutlkXVFITMQBPOmWlkVx1p5H0UisvnBesg?rtime=3q_Efs-u2kg). Following this template is helpful (almost necessary) in aligning your documentation with the rubric outcomes. So while not technically required, it is highly recommended. -->

Preserve the template's section titles, and order, and submit all four parts as a single document (preferably a pdf). With a long, complicated document, aligning content to competencies presents a challenge. Don't make things difficult for the evaluator by spreading the content over several documents in an unfamiliar format.

### Student Resources

- [Student Resource Hub](https://resource-hub.wgu.edu/)
- [Writing Center](https://my.wgu.edu/success-centers/writing-center)
- [Writing Center Knowledge Base](https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/Writing-Center-Knowledge-Base/tkb-p/C770_kb)
- [WGU Math Center](https://my.wgu.edu/success-centers/math-center). The Math Center is [$e^{2\pi i}$](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=e%5E%282*pi*i%29)!
- [WGU Programming Center](https://westerngovernorsuniversity.sharepoint.com/sites/ProgrammingCenter)

(resources:gen:grammarly)=

### Grammarly.com

Check your grammar using [Grammarly.com](https://www.grammarly.com/) ![grammarly](https://github.com/ashejim/C769/blob/main/url_images/icon-grammarly.png?raw=true#icon) (it's what the evaluators use). Style is not assessed (blue and green), but even a few grammar mistakes will prevent competency in *Professional Communication*. The free side has been sufficient, but if using the online app, you sometimes need to wait before mistakes are caught.

:::{warning}
Students have reported missed mistakes when using the Google doc Grammarly extension. Therefore, we advise copying content directly into the app or purchasing the premium version and checking grammar in MS Word.
