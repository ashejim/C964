:::{warning}
On 9/25/2023, C964 was updated to a new version. Though the rubirc and task directions were reworded, **the actual requirements and their assessment criteria are unchanged.** Over the next month, this website will be revised to better align with version 4, but your best option for success is still to refer first to this website.

<!-- :::{warning}
When opening the official C964 COS page you may see pop-up message below. *Please ignore the text in bold.* While C964 will be updated on 9/25, you CAN stay in the current version. Those who have started the course (i.e., have an assigned CI) will NOT automatically be moved to the new one -unless they request it. Furthermore, the update will not change the project requirements. Therefore, your best option for success is to move forward, follow the advice of your program mentor, and refer to this website.

The pop-up (bold text can be ignored):
>Hello! A new version of the Computer Science Capstone will launch on September 25, 2023. The new version includes some new course content as well as an updated assessment and rubric. If you've already engaged in most of the course content, and especially if you have started working on your project, **your best option for success is to complete your project before this date. If you are unable to do so, you will be moved into this new version on September 25th and will have to revisit the course content and your project.** If you have any questions, please reach out to your instructor or program mentor.

# Welcome to C964!

Welcome! For the Computer Science capstone project, you'll develop and present a machine learning application solving a proposed problem. The problem, the solution, and the presentation as a final product are up to you! The capstone allows you to demonstrate the application of skills collected throughout the CS program. Most importantly, that crucial skill setting CS majors apart, learning and applying new things. You are a problem-solver; this is your opportunity to shine.

The capstone includes three parts:

1. **Task 1:** Get course instructor topic approval -a preliminary step to ensure you started in the right direction.
2. **Task 2 part C:** The "app." Develop a working application of machine learning (ML).
3. **Task 2 parts D, A, & B:** Documentation communicating your product's value and development process to audiences of varying technical understanding.

## Start Here

First, understand the project's requirements. What they are -and what they aren't. Watch the following video:

And review the [What does the application need to do?](https://ashejim.github.io/C964/task2_part_c.html#what-does-the-application-need-to-do) section and part C of the [Task 2 template](https://westerngovernorsuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/jim_ashe_wgu_edu/ERGxhsNfkbhEutlkXVFITMQBPOmWlkVx1p5H0UisvnBesg?rtime=3q_Efs-u2kg).

Like the [*C950 -Data Structures and Algorithms II* task](https://ashejim.github.io/C964/task2_c/task2_part_c.html#can-i-use-my-c950-project-for-c964) and *C951 -Intro to AI* tasks 1 and 2, this project consists of a working application, ([Task 2 part C](task2_part_c)), and accompanying documentation, [Task 2 parts A, B, & D](task2_doc). But because of the breadth of allowable topics, we want to ensure you start working in the right direction, and thus require all topics to be approved by yout assigned course instructor, [Task 1](task1). So your next step is choosing a topic and having it approved.
