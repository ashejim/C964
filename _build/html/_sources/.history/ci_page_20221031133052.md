The capstone was designed to showcase knowledge and skills accumulated throughout the BSCS degree program. Helping you integrate your accumulative expertise into a passing capstone is the primary responsibility of your assigned C964 course instructor. However, the capstone was designed by WGU's product development team with the expectation that the necessary skills have already been mastered. So questions regarding those skills, e.g., coding, debugging, mathematics, and machine learning; may be outside the scope of their expertise. 

```{margin}  Which courses are these skills covered?
See the [course map](LINKHERE), but there are major gaps. Noteably, machine learning, data processing, and inferential statistics. Tangential skills such as vector calculus and probability are also missing. BUT the true asset of a computer *science* graduate, is the ability to adapt, learn, and problem solve. Something you've done plenty of and should expect to do your entire career.    
```

In cases when that happens, your C964 instructor will work to direct you to the correct resource. But given the broad range of approaches, languages, and libraries available to use, it should not be expected to find a WGU expert on everything. We recommend reviewing available resources before investing time into your project, and be aware that WGU resources might be limited when choosing tools outside the scope of those listed.

Always practice professional communication:
* Use your WGU email (we may not receive emails from outside WGU).
* Provide a subject, your capstone course (we support all IT college capstones), and your program mentor's name (if not in your signature).
* Clearly state your questions or requests. When contacting non-C964 faculty, provide context and limit questions to the scope of their expertise.
