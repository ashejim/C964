## Choosing a Topic

(task1:choosing-a-topic)=
The approval form ensures you start in the right direction before investing time and effort into [task 2](task2_part_c). Evaluators look for our (instructors') signature, and we look for the following:

1. An application of machine learning (ML).
2. An organizational need for your ML application to help solve.
3. A *basic outline* of your implementation plan.

```{margin} What is *machine learning*?
It's a new field, and answers vary depending on who you ask. But for the purposes of this project, ML is the application of an algorithm to data. Also see [FAQ: What is ML?](task1:faq:what_is_machine_learning?).
```

The "organizational need" requirement gives your project a purpose and audience. From an assessment perspective, it has little other value, so you need not worry about your project's profitability or practical impact. Such criteria are *not* assessed. This is a computer science project, not a business or software project.  

### Data

ML applies an algorithm to data, and you can't apply an algorithm to data -without data. So finding data should be an early step.

A machine learning application is the hard requirement of the capstone, but you can‚Äôt apply an algorithm to data -without data. Moreover, most datasets provide a question to answer, e.g., predictions, classifications, or recommendations for which an ‚Äúorganizational need‚Äù can always be found.

- Simulated data

```{note}
*No minimal data complexity or processing is required.* Choosing data which needs less processing or simplifying a dataset (you don't have to use it all) can make the project technically more accessible.

:::

#### Supervised Learning

If the answers for what you are trying to predict (the dependent variable; also called *tagged* or *labeled*) are in the data, then a [supervised method](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html) is the way to go. Using the other features (independent variables) as input, a supervised algorithm can *train* a function to predict a dependent variable for new unseen dependent variables. For predicting numbers, e.g., profit, temperature, etc., a *regression* method should be used. For predicting categories, e.g., yes/no, blue/red, spam/ham, etc., a *classification* method should be used.

- *Regression* algorithms predict numbers. Examples include linear regression, polynomial regression, decision tree regression, random forest regression, and many more.
<!--  https://www.kaggle.com/code/duyguay12/regression-examples-for-machine-learning -->

- *Classification* algorithms predict categories. Examples include logistic regression (see the margin), naive Bayes, support vector machine, decision tree, and many others.  

(task1:choosing_topic:logistic)=

```{margin} Logisitc regression: regression or classification?
Really both, but most often, it's used for classification. Logistic regression uses input variables to predict the *probability* of an outcome, a number between 0.0 and 1.0 -hence "regression." However, using that probability to predict whether an outcome occurs (yes/no) is classification.     
```

#### Unsupervised Learning

If what you are trying to find is not directly in the data, then an u[nsupervised method](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/unsupervised_learning.html) might be used. Unsupervised algorithms identify patterns in the data. Common approaches include clustering (e.g., k-means clustering, expectation-maximization distribution, and agglomerative hierarchical), dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA and LDA), and anomaly detection (e.g., outlier factor and isolation forest).

#### Reinforced Learning

Sometimes solutions need to adapt to particular situations. That is, the algorithms need to learn how to make decisions. For example, a robot needs to navigate a never before seen maze. By awarding (or punishing) a robot's state after decisions, an algorithm can be progressively trained to predict decisions maximizing results. Reinforced methods can be more challenging to develop than supervised or unsupervised methods.

```{note}
Need help determining which particular algorithm will work best? That's OK! You won't know until you've spent time investigating and experimenting. But that's not the point of Task 1. For now, you only need to identify the type, i.e., supervised, unsupervised, or reinforced. *Any ML algorithm* given in Task 1 appropriate for your data will be accepted, and you might do something different in task without needing to revise Task 1 (see the [FAQ](task1:faq:change_task1) below).
```

### Where to start? Data or the ML algorithm?

It's best to consider both. In a "real-world" scenario, you would likely be given data to analyze and a problem to solve. So starting with the data, and then determining the proper ML tools is most natural. However, you get to choose the problem and hence the tools needed to solve it -provided you have data fitting that problem. For example, someone interested in image recognition might restrict their data search to sets of labeled images. To simplify coding steps, they might look at images with standard sizes or take a subset of the images limiting the number of classifications. At any point, the problem or chosen algorithm can be revised to better fit what you want or can do (even after graduation üòÑ). A suggested approach:

1. Find some data to match your preferred ML method.
2. Find an ML algorithm you can apply to that data.
3. Formulate an "organizational need" helped by that application.

```{margin} Unsure about which ML method to use?
Look for labeled data for which a supervised learning classification method can be apllied. This method most easily fits all the rubirc requirements. 
```

##### WGU Capstone Excellence Archive

The [Capstone Excellence Archive](https://westerngovernorsuniversity.sharepoint.com/sites/capstonearchives/excellence/Pages/UndergraduateInformation.aspx) includes a wide range of completed projects. Reviewing them may help get ideas, provide inspiration, and deepen understanding of the requirements. However, keep in mind that they all are *above and beyond* the requirements. Therefore, don't use these as examples of what's needed to meet the requirements. For more down-to-earth examples of what's required, see the [examples](task1:examples:completed_examples) above.

(task1:approval)=

## Topic Approval

Once you've decided on a topic, complete the approval form following the template below and *email it to your [C964 assigned instructor](mailto:myC964capstoneinstructor@wgu.edu?cc=my%20program%20mentor&subject=C964:%20capstone%20topic%20approval) for approval.*

> [![Thumbnail of the topic approval form template. The word "Template" is stamped on it diagonally in green.](https://github.com/ashejim/C964/blob/main/url_images/template_task1.png?raw=true#image-thumb)](https://westerngovernorsuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/jim_ashe_wgu_edu/EaH8yexFJjhDp5hnrcAZeKoB6XxU9r8Z5IH1QqVLmVu87w?e=OwRtpe)

```{note}
The approval form only needs to be a *rough* outline of a passing project. **Changes from task 1 to task 2 are allowed and expected.** Determining the finer details of a complex project takes time and effort, which you won't invest until task 2.  
```

**Project topic and purpose:** Describe the problem (the "organizational need") your project will solve.

**Non-descriptive method(s):**  These methods infer from the data, i.e., make predictions or prescriptions. Examples include classification models, regression, image recognition, etc. Typically, but not necessarily, this is where ML is applied.

**Descriptive methods:** These methods describe and help understand the data, e.g., mean, median, bar plot, scatterplot, k-means clustering, etc. Three visualizations are required. The visualizations are typically descriptive and can count as your descriptive method.

```{warning}
You must identify a machine learning application in either the descriptive or non-descriptive section. Most often, the non-descriptive method uses ML, e.g., a classification model allowing the user to provide input to an app that returns a prediction.
```

Directly emailing your [assigned course instructor](mailto:myC964capstoneinstructor@wgu.edu?cc=my%20program%20mentor&subject=C964:%20capstone%20topic%20approval) (identified on your C964 COS page; or find them [here](ci_c964)) is typically the fastest and best way to get a signature. Whether emailing [ugcapstoneit@wgu.edu](mailto:ugcapstoneit@wgu.edu?cc=my%20course%20instructor&subject=C964:%20capstone%20topic%20approval) or your CI directly, always practice professional communication:

- Use your WGU email (non-WGU emails may be categorized as spam).
- Provide a subject, your capstone course (we support all IT college capstones), and your program mentor's name (if not in your signature).
- Clearly state your questions or requests. 

```{warning}
The submitted topic approval form must be *signed by a [C964 course instructor](ci_c964)*. Forms without a signature are automatically returned without further review.  
```

(task1:waiver_form)=

## Waiver Form

<!-- Everyone must submit a waiver form stating either no restricted information was used OR the use of any restricted information is authorized. -->

```{note}
the waiver form is **only** required if your project is based upon or includes restricted information. If no waiver form is submitted, Task 1 *B: Capstone Release Form*, passes automatically.
```

In most cases, obtaining authorization can be avoided by fabricating or masking identifying information. But if you choose to move forward using restricted information, you must obtain documented permissions and submit them along with a waiver form to Assessments.

> [![Thumbnail of the waiver form. The word "Waiver" is stamped on it diagonally in green.](https://github.com/ashejim/C964/blob/main/url_images/waiver.png?raw=true#image-thumb)](https://westerngovernorsuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/jim_ashe_wgu_edu/ESLuMNRuDjpCrKvqWaC6cywB4I97WEPdk5MRZRq4LfmFhQ) 

(task1:faq)=

## FAQ

### Do I need to set up an appointment to get approval?

No. Usually, students email the approval form to their [assigned instructor](ci_c964). We then sign it or follow up with questions. However, if you have questions about the requirements or need help choosing a topic, you are encouraged to set up an appointment. A 15-30 minute phone call can address most questions or concerns.

### I have questions. Should I email the question or set up an appointment?

It's up to you. But for specific questions, emails are usually best and almost always faster. Appointments are great for general discussions or when you're unsure what to ask. For technical coding questions or if you are unsure who to contact, see the [course faculty page](cipage).

(task1:faq:change_task1)=

### What if I start working on task 2 and want to change things? Do I need to resubmit task 1?

No, not unless it's an entirely different topic. Minor changes from task 1 to task 2 are expected and allowed *without updating the approval form*. Evaluators will not rigorously compare tasks 1 and 2. Task 2 is where the work is, and even with complete topic changes, at most, you'll be asked to revise the approval form (if at all). So never let task 1 dictate what you do in task 2.

### Can I use projects from other WGU courses?

You can use any of your work or academic projects (at WGU or elsewhere), provided no proprietary information is used without permission. Don't worry about self-plagiarism, as the similarity check will identify and ignore it. Just as in reusing work projects, expect to modify and remold past academic assignments to meet the project requirements.

<!-- resume check here 6/8/2023 15:30 -->
(task1:faq:can_i_use_my_c951_task_3)=

### Can I use my C950 project for C964?

Yes. You can use any of your own academic or professional work for C964 including the C950 project (Data Structures & Algorithms II). Though the document (Task 2 parts A, B, and D) will need some adjustment, the coding portion of C950 almost meets all the requirements of the C964 application (Task 2 part C). Referring to the [Task 2 part C page](https://ashejim.github.io/C964/task2_c/task2_part_c.html#what-does-the-application-need-to-do), the C964 application needs the following:

1. **Data ‚Üí ML model:** C950 applies a reinforced learning algorithm to the distance and package data.

2. **Accuracy Metric:** The total miles. The maximum allowed miles for C950 is 120, which WGU Assessment Department has already determined to be "efficient."

3. **Visualizations:** This will need to be added, but any three pictures will meet the requirements.

4. **User Application:** The require console user interface required for C950 allows the user to provide input and apply the algorithm towards solving the problem.

So only the three images will need to be added. Furthermore, you are free to adjust the distance and package data as desired. For example, dropping some of the delivery restrictions requiring different trucks or certain packages to be delveired together, and it will be easier to apply a more sophisticated algorithm. Say a [Monte Carlo method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) such as [Simulated Annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing).

<img src="./_images/simulated_annealing.gif" height="150px" alt = "A short animated image demonstraiting simulated annealing applied to a two dimensional travleing salesperson problem.

### Can I use my C951 task 3? Should I use it?

You can reuse anything you've of your own academic or professional work, including copying verbatim from C951 task 3. If it's convenient, feel free to do it. But at best, the time saved is little. At worst, you might get bogged down trying to work on two projects simultaneously and going with an unnecessarily complex C964 topic. If you have time, consider completing C964 first, as parts A and B of task 2 can always be used verbatim for task 3 of C951.

Here are some points to consider:

- C951.3 is just a written project, typically around five pages (I'm guessing; ask your C951 instructor), and can be completed in a single afternoon. Comparatively, C964 requires a working machine learning application and accompanying documentation, typically around 20 pages.
- C951.3 only relates to parts A and B of C964.2. These parts are just a framework for providing a general audience and purpose for the ML application. If present, these parts almost always pass. Furthermore, they'll have to be at least partially rewritten anyways. Parts C and D of C964 are what evaluators care about, but C951.3 has no corresponding parts C and D.
- Rewriting C951.3 content for a different C964 topic takes little additional work.
- As it's just a written project, students often pick a complex topic for C951.3. But then they feel pressured to use the same complex topic for C964 and struggle with creating the app.
- Trying to comprehend two projects at once is just more difficult. 

Whatever you do for C964 can meet the requirements of C951 task 3. If you have plenty of time, completing C964 first might be the best option.

(task1:faq:the_rubric_is_confusing)=

### Help, the rubric is confusing! The directions seem to require items outside the scope of the project, e.g., "implementation of interactive queries." The directions have parts A, B, C, and D, but the rubric has "Outcomes" 1-6. How do these align?

*We do not advise directly following the official rubric for C964* (it is under development). Follow the guidelines found on this webpage and the [Task 2 template](https://westerngovernorsuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/jim_ashe_wgu_edu/ESLuMNRuDjpCrKvqWaC6cywB4I97WEPdk5MRZRq4LfmFhQ). Because of the ambiguity of the official rubric (how do directions A-D align with Outcomes 1-6?), following this template is helpful (almost necessary) in aligning your documentation with the rubric outcomes. So while following the template format is not technically required, it is highly recommended.

Preserve the template's section titles, and order, and submit all four parts as a single document (preferably a pdf). With a long, complicated document, aligning content to competencies presents a challenge. Don't make things difficult for the evaluator by spreading the content over several documents in an unfamiliar format.

### Do I need an "electronic signature" as specified in the official rubric?

No, you can type in your name, use a "fancy" font, or insert an image of your signature.  

### What are the common reasons for task 1 being returned?

1. No instructor signature on the approval form. You need to send it to us and get a signature *before* submitting it to Assessments.
2. Both or neither box is marked on the waiver form. Mark one and only one box. See the [waiver form instructions](task1:waiver_form)

Note, the waiver form is **only** required if your project is based upon or included restricted information. Task 1 *B: Capstone Release Form*, passes automatically if no waiver form is submitted, i.e., the waiver only needs to be submitted if it's needed for permissions.

### How many attempts are allowed for each task?

You have *unlimited* attempts for both tasks 1 and 2. However, incomplete submissions or submissions significantly falling short of the minimum requirements may be *locked* from further submissions without instructor approval. Furthermore, such submissions do not receive meaningful evaluator comments. It's in your best interest to the complete minimal requirements to the best of your understanding.

### What is a descriptive method?

Anything that describes the data. Histograms, scatterplots, pie charts -all the familiar descriptive statistics techniques are included. ML methods such as k-means clustering can also be descriptive. Whether a method is descriptive or non-descriptive is determined by its use. For example, using a regression line to describe the relationship between variables is descriptive, but using the line to predict a variable or claim a correlation between the variables exist is inferential (non-descriptive).

Descriptive and non-descriptive methods do not need to be explicitly identified in task 2. The visualizations and requirements of the user application will satisfy these parts respectively. The distinction is only made in the approval form so we can easily identify where and how ML will be applied.  

### What is a non-descriptive method?

Anything that infers from the data, e.g., making predictions, recommendations, identifying correlations, inferring from correlations, etc. Also, see the comments above.

Descriptive and non-descriptive methods do not need to be explicitly identified in task 2. The visualizations and requirements of the user application will satisfy these parts respectively. The distinction is only made in the approval form so we can easily identify where and how ML will be applied.

### What is machine learning?

That depends on who you ask! But for this project, it is an algorithm applied to data.

For computer science, Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (a subfield of mathematics), broadly defined as the development of machines capable of self-adjusting behavior based on data. However, from the data science perspective, machine learning is generally defined as using algorithms to identify patterns, make predictions, etc., from data. That is, machine learning is a goal, not a technique. So, for example, a data scientist (and the evaluators) consider linear regression machine learning -when it's used as a prediction model. However, a mathematician would politely (or not so politely) disagree with a 19<sup>th</sup>-century equation being classified as ML.

### Can I use libraries outside the standard (Python, Java, etc.) installation?

Yes. Unlike C950 (Data Structures & Algorithms II), you are allowed and encouraged to use outside libraries. All the major languages, but particularly Python, have a wide array of highly developed ML tools. The C964 capstone is about applying these tools -not their development.

### What language, libraries, and platforms should I use?

You can use whatever you like. However, we recommend using Python and the [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) (aka sklearn) library. In addition to having an extensive collection of ML-specific tools and tutorials, WGU has better faculty support for these. Jupyter Notebook is a great place to start for the app front end. Passing applications are often submitted as the Notebook file (.ipynb) and data files. Jupyter Notebooks are a great way to present code and information together, but they can also progressively be developed into a more polished product. Students are often tempted to use Java because of their JavaFX experience in software II (C195), but a GUI is not required, and Python is overall better suited for everything which is required. Furthermore, implementing a GUI with Python or Jupyter Notebooks is not difficult (see these [widget examples](sup_class_ex:user_interface)).

A development path might look like the following:

> Python IDE &rarr; Jupyter notebook &rarr; notebook with widgets &rarr; hosted notebook with widgets &rarr; web app.

Provided the [minimal app criteria](task2c:appreqs) are met, submitting at any point along this path will pass part C.

(task1:faq:gui)=

### What sort of user interface do I need? Do I need a GUI?

No, a GUI is *not* required. Your app must be usable by the "client" to solve the proposed problem. If the evaluators can run your app as intended, playing the role of the "client," following your [user guide](task2_doc:userguide), then your app will be considered to have a user-friendly interface. This can be done through a GUI and widgets, but using the command line or reading user data from a local directory will also suffice.  

### Are there length requirements for the documentation?

No. What you see in the examples and template are just guidelines. The individual evaluator determines what qualifies as "sufficient detail," which further varies depending on the project and writing style. If you feel you've met the requirements, simply move on to the next section. Upon submission, it will pass, or they will request more details. In the latter case, you can then focus on revising the more narrow scope as directed by the evaluator's comments, which is generally more efficient than overworking the entire project.

### I've completed the task 2 documentation. Should I send it to my course instructor for review?

If you have specific questions or concerns -yes. However, in most cases, it's best just to submit. What suffices as "sufficient detail" is highly subjective. We can always tell you to add more, but if you've done your best to fulfill the requirements, submit it and let them tell you which (if any) parts need revision. At best, it passes; at worst, we address the issues cited by the evaluator -and then it passes. Responding to the more narrow focus of the evaluator's comments is generally easier than overworking the entire project.

You have *unlimited* submissions but limited time. So typically this is the best and most efficient approach.

### I only have a Linux (or Mac) machine. Will evaluators be able to run my code?

Technically (and unfortunately), we are a "Windows" university, and all submitted projects should be able to run in Windows. However, being Windows-compatible is *nowhere specifically required* in the C964 rubric, and doing so would be a little silly for a computer science program. That said, WGU evaluators are only issued Windows 10 machines, and they may have difficulty running a Linux, Android, or Mac app without special instructions. Therefore for non-Windows apps, we recommend providing explicit instructions in the [user guide](task2_doc_d:user_guide) for a Windows 10 user to run your code, such as using a [virtual machine](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-run-ubuntu-desktop-on-a-virtual-machine-using-virtualbox#1-overview), a remote machine, or using a [Linux subsystem](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-10#1-overview).

### How complex does my data, algorithm, or model need to be?

It must be complex enough to meet the needs of your project. There is no explicit minimal complexity for any of these items. However, the model must meet the needs of the "organizational need" and the data must be appropriate for developing the model which could indirectly impose a minimal complexity. For example, a supervised model requires two variables.

### Are there any restrictions on which datasets I can choose?

Only that data must be legally available to use and share with evaluators. For example, using data belonging to a current employer would require submitting a [waiver form](task1:waiverform).

- You *can* use any dataset found on [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets).
- You *can* use simulated data.
- You *can* use data used for previous projects (submitted by you or others).
- You only need to apply for [IRB review](https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/Frequently-Asked-Questions/WGU-IRB-and-Human-Subject-Protections-FAQ/ta-p/2002) if you are *collecting* data involving human participants (this is very rare). Otherwise, your project is in IRB compliance.
