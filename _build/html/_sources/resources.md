## Examples

The examples found here are of actual passing tasks 1 and 2, *flaws and all*. To best represent what might be accepted, we’ve made no corrections. See the excellence archives to review better projects.

These examples (and most of those in archives) were written using an old Task 2 Template. In the coming months, we will add more recent examples following the new template.

**Example A:**

- [task 1 ex. A](https://github.com/ashejim/C964/blob/main/resources/example_task1-a.pdf)

- [task 2 ex. A](https://github.com/ashejim/C964/blob/main/resources/example_task2-a.pdf) (part C not available)

**Example B:**

- [task 1 ex. B](https://github.com/ashejim/C964/blob/main/resources/example_task1-b.pdf) 

- [task 2 ex. B](https://github.com/ashejim/C964/blob/main/resources/example_task2-b.pdf) (part C not available)

**WGU Capstone Excellence Archive**

The [Capstone Excellence Archive](https://westerngovernorsuniversity.sharepoint.com/sites/capstonearchives/excellence/Pages/UndergraduateInformation.aspx) includes a wide range of completed projects. Reviewing them may help get ideas, provide inspiration, and understand the requirements. However, keep in mind that they all are *above and beyond* the requirements. Therefore, don't use these as examples of what's needed to meet the requirements. For a more down-to-earth example of what's required, see the [examples](resources:examples) above.

:::{tip}
Currently, most of these examples (including those in the archives) follow the old template. However, the advice on this site aligns with the latest version of the [Task 2 template](./resources/C964_task_2_template.docx) as the new template meets all the documentation requirements while being more succinct and clear. We recommend using the new template for both SIM2 and SIM3.

### Excellence Archive

The Capstone Excellence Archive includes a wide range of completed projects. When reviewing archived capstones, keep in mind that they all are, by definition, above and beyond the requirements. Therefore, do not use these as examples of what’s needed to meet the requirements. For a more down-to-earth example of what’s required, see the [examples](resources:examples) above.

## Task 2 Parts A, B, & C (the documentation) Resources

Part C is your submitted application. See all our available resources here: [task 2 part C](task2_part_c)

(resources:task2doc:doctemplate)=

### Task 2 Parts A, B, and D Template & Part C Guide

Write your proposal following **C964 Task 2 documentation template**:

> [![Image of the first page of the Task 2 documentation template](https://github.com/ashejim/C964/blob/main/url_images/template_task2.png?raw=true#image-thumb)](./resources/C964_task_2_template.docx)

<!-- Contrasting the recommended approach to most WGU projects you've passed, e.g., C950 and C951, *we do not advise completing your application (part C) OR writing your document (parts A) following the specific items listed in the official rubric _or task directions.*  Written holistically, many find it difficult to align the task directions (A-D) to the rubric outcomes (1-6). Please refer to the guidelines on this webpage and the [Task 2 template](https://westerngovernorsuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/jim_ashe_wgu_edu/ERGxhsNfkbhEutlkXVFITMQBPOmWlkVx1p5H0UisvnBesg?rtime=3q_Efs-u2kg). Following this template is helpful (almost necessary) in aligning your documentation with the rubric outcomes. So while not technically required, it is highly recommended. -->

Preserve the template's section titles, and order, and submit all four parts as a single document (preferably a pdf). With a long, complicated document, aligning content to competencies presents a challenge. Don't make things difficult for the evaluator by spreading the content over several documents in an unfamiliar format.

(resources:gen:grammarly)=

### Grammarly.com

Check your grammar using [Grammarly.com](https://www.grammarly.com/) ![grammarly](https://github.com/ashejim/C769/blob/main/url_images/icon-grammarly.png?raw=true#icon) (it's what the evaluators use). Style is not assessed (blue and green), but even a few grammar mistakes will prevent competency in *Professional Communication*. The free side has been sufficient, but if using the online app, you sometimes need to wait before mistakes are caught.

:::{warning}
Students have reported missed mistakes when using the Google doc Grammarly extension. Therefore, we advise copying content directly into the app or purchasing the premium version and checking grammar in MS Word.

### Welcome Email

```{admonition} A Welcome Email
Welcome to C964! See the [C964 website](https://ashejim.github.io/C964/intro.html) for almost everything you need (videos, coding examples, doc examples, templates, etc.).To allow for a broad range of projects, the rubric’s language is necessarily broad but lacks specificity, and the specifics in the task directions contain items not necessarily required. You can ignore the official rubric and directions, the website and the [Task 2 template](https://ashejim.github.io/C964/task2_doc/task2_doc.html#task-2-documentation-template), best outline what's requried.

Your project must apply machine learning (ML) to solve a problem. Using ML requires data, and fortunately, open, machine-readable datasets are readily available, e.g., [Kaggle, Github, etc](https://ashejim.github.io/C964/task1.html#data). Using a dataset, find a question to answer or problem to solve, and then choose that as your "business" problem to solve. Here are some points to consider as you begin to think of a topic for task 1:

- The “app” (part C of Task 2 ) is most commonly passed by submitting a Jupyer notebook (.ipynb) and data file (.csv). But you can use whatever tools you like.
- Students typically apply ML tools from a Python library to the non-descriptive method and then use whatever is most appropriate for the descriptive method ([coding examples](https://ashejim.github.io/C964/task2_c/task2_part_c.html#task-2-part-c-the-application)) 
- There is no accuracy or complexity requirement for your models other than it applies some machine learning. 
- Your submitted project must have a []"user-friendly" interface](https://ashejim.github.io/C964/task2_c/example_sup_class/sup_class_ex-ui.html), but a GUI is not required. This is a CS project (not a software project); evaluators deal with a wide array of technical projects and need a way to review your work.
- Task 1 is a preliminary exercise ensuring students begin in the right direction. Changing details from task 1 to task 2 is allowed and typical.

To get some ideas, watch this [video](https://ashejim.github.io/C964/intro.html#start-here) and review these [examples](https://ashejim.github.io/C964/task1.html#topic-summary-examples). Next, complete the topic approval form and email it to me to be signed for approval. Set up an appointment if you have questions, but topic approval does not require an appointment. Following approval, see the  C964 Task 2 webpage and get started on Task 2. If you have any questions about a topic, schedule email (fastest) or set an appointment (best for general discussion) -it's why we're here!
