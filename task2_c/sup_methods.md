(supervised_methods)=
# Supervised Methods

- Data Needs
- Referral and links to examples CLASS and REG.

## Basic Process

process-> split data-> train -> test -> back to train

(supervised_methods:train)=
## Train

stuff about training

### Choose a library?

adv of choosing one to start that's flexible. Rec sklearn or tensorflows.

## Validation

### Accuracy Metric

You'll need one etc. 
- Classification. Simple example with code?
- Regression. Simple 2d linear example with code?

### Simple

- split data: train test
- ideal split? 

### Validation Process 2?

- split data: train, validate (practice; pre-assessment), test (final; objective assessment)

### Cross Validation

- image explanation
- process exp
- simple code example

## Back to train

- link to [Train](supervised_methods:train)
- Train, test, improve, train, test, ...
- Mix of understand data, the algorithms, and intuition.
