*Most* of task 3 will update task 2 from the future to the past tense. As such, task 3 should be similar in length and detail to task 2. Review the [task 3 examples](resources:examples) to understand what evaluators expect.  Differences between tasks 2 and 3 are highlighted in the [task 3 template](task3:template) and discussed in the video. You must update task 2 as follows:
<div class = "tasklist">

   <input type="checkbox"> Update the title page, TOC,  headers, and footers.

   <input type="checkbox"> Rewrite corresponding sections from task 2 in the past tense adjusting as necessary following the task 3 rubric. All dates should be in the past.

   <input type="checkbox"> Section [B: Other Works](task3:B) must have **three** new sources different from those in section B of task 2.

   <input type="checkbox"> Write section [G: Unanticipated Requirements](task3:G). 

   <input type="checkbox"> For section [H: Conclusion](task3:H), revise *Outcomes* from task 2, discussing the results and effectiveness of the completed project.

   <input type="checkbox"> For section [I:](task3:I) Project Deliverables](task3:I), add examples of deliverables to the appendices.

   <input type="checkbox"> Following APA guidelines, [check grammar and sources](task3:grammar), export as a pdf, and submit.

   <input type="checkbox"> Submit, pass, and graduate! 

</div>

```{warning}
Submissions with missing sections are automatically returned. If everything went as planned, explain why. The narrative following the *Timeline* and an *Unanticapted Requirements* section is still required.   
```

(task3:A)=

## Section A: Overview

Revise [Task 2 section A3](task2:A), adjusting for any variances and providing a summary of the completed project. In addition, you can reuse any content from related task 3 sections [C](task3:C) and [D](task3:D).

```{tip}
- Write this section last or return to it after writing the Conclusion. 
- The required depth of detail is up to the subjectivity of the evaluator. Though summaries are typically short, there is no penalty for *too much* detail. 
```

(task3:B)=

## Section B: Other Works

The requirements for this section are identical to that of [task 2 section B](task2:B) -only you must have **three** works different from those in task 2 cited following [APA guidelines](task3:grammar), e.g., (Author year).

- [WGU's library](https://wgu.libguides.com/friendly.php?s=library)
- [google.scholar.com](https://scholar.google.com/)

Content from part B of task 2 can be included, but cannot satisfy the task 3 requirements. So cite the task 2 sources if needed elsewhere, but it is recommended to not include the task 2 sources in this section.

(task3:C)=

## Section C: Changes to Project Environment

Using task 2 sections [D](task2:D) and [E](task2:E) from task 2, describe how your project *changed* the client's environment.

As a convenience to the evaluators, you may copy content from your [Task 2 section D](task2:D) labeling it as *Original Environment*, and then add new material (a paragraph typically suffices) describing how the project changed the original environment. For example:
> **Original Environment**:
> 
> Company X currently is using out-of-date Linksys WRT54GL wireless routers as Wi-Fi
access points. As a result... 
>
> After the project was completed, the outdated Linksys WRT54G was replaced with...

(task3:D)=

## Section D: Methodology

Adding any variations, revise [task 2 section E](task2:E) from task 2 from the future to the past tense.

(task3:E)=

## Section E: Project Goals and Objectives

Discuss how completed goals and objectives from [task 2 section F](task2:F) were met. *If* any goals or objectives were not met, discuss why.  

(task3:F)=

## Section F: Project Timeline

<!-- TODO add? Also, do I need planned and actual dates on the milestones?
For the timeline? Yes. They need a timeline for all items on the table, and they need to compare those dates to what was proposed. However, it doesn’t have actually to match task 2. The point is so they won’t have to open task 2 when assessing the timeline narrative and ‘unanticipated requirements’ of task 3.
 -->

1. Update the timeline table from [task 2 section G](task2:G) with columns for *Planned Duration*, *Actual Duration*, *Actual Start Date*, and *Actual End Date*.

   |Milestone or Deliverable  |Planned Duration  | Actual Duration  | Actual Start Date| Actual End date
   --- | --- | ---| ---| ---|
   |Some milestones |7 days|7 days|7/23/2022|7/30/2022|
   |Some deliverables |14 days|10 days|7/18/2022|7/28/2022|
   |$\vdots$ |$\vdots$ |$\vdots$ |$\vdots$ |$\vdots$ |

   ```{note}
   *All* dates must be in the past. Task 3 is a conclusion report. Write as if you recently completed the project -even if the dates do not align with the task 2 projected end dates. Evaluators understand this is a written exercise, and academic timelines rarely sync with real-world timelines. See the [FAQ](task3:faq:timeline) for more details. 
   ```

2. Following the updated timeline, write a narrative explaining any differences from the projected proposal timeline, [task 2 section G](task2:G). If there were no variances, explain why.

   ```{warning}
   Do **not** leave this section blank. It is easy to overlook, but submissions with no timeline narrative will not be accepted. 
   ```

(task3:G)=

## Section G: Unanticipated Requirements

Describe any unanticipated requirements and how you dealt with them. You should repeat anything from the narrative section of [Task 3 section F](task3:F). If everything went as planned (which is a tad unrealistic), explain why. Do not leave this section blank.  

(task3:H)=

## Section H: Conclusion

Summarize the results and potential effects of your completed project compared to the expected outcomes outlined in [task 2 section H](task2:H).  

(task3:I)=

## Deliverables

### Appendices

In the appendices you must include at least **two** things you created that demonstrate the project's completion. The included items need only be *examples* of actual deliverables. They can be fabricated entirely, examples, or parts of actual deliverables. This section should be included at the end of the document.

```{tip}
If reusing materials from an open source or actual project, mask any identifying information.

<img src="https://github.com/ashejim/C769/blob/main/url_images/edit_deliverable.gif?raw=true" height="175px" alt= "An animated GIF showing how to modify images."/>
```

Accepted items include the following:

- Code or script samples
- Screenshots of deliverable
- Process diagrams such as flowcharts or UMLs
- Visualizations such as charts, tables, or graphs
- Network diagrams
- Training certificates/questions
- The technical IT product

### Section I: Project deliverables

Describe each deliverable in the appendices and how it demonstrates evidence of project completion. Refer directly to the corresponding items by its appendix, e.g., "under Appendix A", so readers can easily identify which appendix is being described.

(task2:grammar)=

## Grammar, Sources, and APA

It's easy to overlook them when focusing on content, but grammar, sources, and APA formatting are the most common reasons for rejected submissions!
Check your grammar using [Grammarly.com](https://www.grammarly.com/) ![grammarly_icon](https://github.com/ashejim/C769/blob/main/url_images/icon-grammarly.png?raw=true#icon) (it's what the evaluators use). Style is not assessed (Grammarly marks these in blue, green, or purple), but even a few grammar errors (marked in red) will prevent competency in *Professional Communication*. The free side has been sufficient, but if using the online app, you sometimes need to wait before mistakes are caught.

:::{warning}
Students have reported missed mistakes when using the Google doc Grammarly extension. Therefore, we advise copying content directly into the app or purchasing the premium version compatible with MS Word.
:::

Sources and format should follow [APA $7^{\text{th}}$ edition guidelines](https://apastyle.apa.org). Outside of grammar mistakes, most APA errors involve formatting of the sources or in-text citations. In-text citations should be of the form, `(Author, year)`. For more details, see [APA guidelines for citations](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/citations).

Avoid reference errors by using a [referencing tool](resources:general:grammar:sources):

- [MS Word Reference Tool](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-a-bibliography-citations-and-references-17686589-4824-4940-9c69-342c289fa2a5) $\leftarrow$ desktop version only.
- [JabRef](https://www.jabref.org) $\leftarrow$ free and works on most platforms.

(task3:faq)=

## FAQ

### What are the most common reasons task 3 does not pass?

The most common reasons for returned task 3's:

1. Grammar
2. Sources
3. No narrative for [part F, Project Timeline](task3:F).
4. Insufficient details for section X.

1-3 is easily avoidable. Being cited for "insufficient details" is a matter of subjectivity, but it is also easy to fix -just add more details. Since task 3 mostly implements the already passed plan of task 2 -it is mostly already passed.

### How long should task 3 be?

Review the [task 3 examples](resources:examples). As task 3 mainly rewrites task, task 3 is typically similar in length. They will assess task 3 independently of task 2. Don't assume they'll compare the two.  

### My capstone is not a real project. What do I do for the deliverables?

See [section I](task3:I). You only need to provide *examples* of actual deliverables you might provide to clients demonstrating a project's completion.

(task3:faq:timeline)=

### My task 2 timeline has projected end dates of 6 months (since this is what it would take), but I just submitted task 2 and need to complete task 3 now. What should I do?

Evaluators understand this is a written exercise, and academic timelines rarely sync with real-world timelines. *Write as if you recently completed the project* -dates do not need to align with those in task 2, but the task 3 start and end dates *must be in the past.* For example, if task 2 had the following:

   |Milestone or Deliverable  |Duration  | Projected Start Date| Projected End date
   --- | --- | ---| ---|
   |Some milestones |7 days|<span style="color:red">**7/23/2023**</span>|<span style="color:red">**7/30/2023**</span>|
   |Some deliverables |14 days|<span style="color:red">**7/16/2023**</span>|<span style="color:red">**7/30/2023**</span>|
   |$\vdots$ |$\vdots$ |$\vdots$ |$\vdots$ |

But task 3 was submitted on 4/28/2023, it might be adjusted by moving back dates such that the timeframes are preserved as follows:

   |Milestone or Deliverable  |Planned Duration  | Actual Duration  | Actual Start Date| Actual End date
   --- | --- | ---| ---| ---|
   |Some milestones |7 days|7 days|<span style="color:green">**4/21/2023**</span>|<span style="color:green">**4/28/2023**</span>|
   |Some deliverables |14 days|14 days|<span style="color:green">**4/14/2023**</span>|<span style="color:green">**4/28/2023**</span>|
   |$\vdots$ |$\vdots$ |$\vdots$ |$\vdots$ |$\vdots$ |

The narrative following the timeline can then explain that the project started earlier than expected (even if these dates preceded task 2's submission).

### I've completed task 3, but task 2 is still in the assessment queue. Should I wait until task 2 passes submitting task 3?

If you're nearing the end of your term, you should submit task 3 as soon as it's ready. If task 2 gets returned, task 3 will also automatically be returned. However, if it passes, task 3 will keep its place in the assessment queue.

### My task was returned for "In-text citations could not be found..."

**My task two was returned for *sources* stating:**
> "In-text citations could not be found for portions of the task that have been quoted or paraphrased... "
**What does this comment mean?**

This comment indicates they could not find a matching in-text citation for every source on your reference list. Check that each reference has a match following APA style, e.g., (Author, year), and remove any references without matches. Use a [referencing tool](resources:general:grammar:sources) to create, manage references, and avoid such errors. Follow the in-text citations and the reference page format of the [tasks 2 and 3 examples](resources:examples).
