- ~~Update T.2 b/b1 advice using the following:~~

    <!-- ~~In the *B & B.1: Review of Other Works* section, you are asked to:
    1. Review 4 resources (articles, blogs, case studies, white papers, videos, etc.).
    2. Summarize 4 resources ( simply tell your reader what's in the resource you reviewed, no need to offer an opinion or analyze it…simply summarize the content…. I recommend at least two paragraphs for each review).
    3. Cite Appropriately (APA Style)
    In the relation to artifact section, you should tell your reader how the information you reviewed & summarized expands the context of the problem you're solving or how it guides/influences the solution you're implementing.  These resources do not have to be a one-to-one match to your project. If you find an article on wood screws and you discern a way to relate it to your project; it will be an acceptable review.~~ -->
